What will it be like to live in the future? Exciting, dynamic, and terrifyingly complicated.

To imagine what it was like to live in the past, we look at the tools people used, the things they painted and drew, and the thoughts they recorded in writing and passed down through stories. We can see that the lives of most of our ancestors largely consisted of manual labor, fighting, and praying. There is a certain brutal elegance to designed objects from the pre-modern world. They suggest that, once upon a time, it took no special training to be human. To solve any problem meant simply to pick up the right tool.
