# The Interface of The Future

What will it be like to live in the future? Exciting, dynamic...and terrifyingly complicated?

## The Present

My first job after college involved designing and building dozens of software tech demos. One day, my boss asked me to make a tech demo that felt "futuristic". Surely other designers had solved this problem before, so I typed "futuristic interface" into Google Image Search for inspiration. [Try it yourself!][0] You might notice something quite funny:

In my mind, here is what these interfaces tell us about the future:

* **The future is overwhelming.** We will be working with so much information so quickly that we'll need to have it all in view, all the time.
* **The future is monotonous.** Future humans will not have any appreciation for any colors besides blue. So future designers will make most interfaces blue.
* **The future is complicated.** So complicated that the only way to represent certain information is in highly detailed, mostly circular, [constantly shifting][1] viziualizations. Only highly trained savants will be able to live there.

Initially, I was surprised that so many designers feel that this is the future we are headed towards. If you ask most designers about their principles, you'll hear something along the lines of "keep it simple". Good designers know that success of many software products is due, in large part, to their simplicity. The best designers of our era are best known for making products simpler, cutting out process steps, and making users feel in control, rather than overwhelmed. <Insert obligatory iPhone reference here\>. So why do some designers feel that future designers will go in the opposite direction and make products more complicated?

Thinking about this question more deeply, I realized that designers may not feel this way themselves at all: the rest of us do. Designers reflect and amplify ideas that we already accept. No one wants to use a complicated product, so designers make products simple. Could it be that we all share a belief that the future will be more complicated, more monotonous, and more overwhelming? If so, it would make sense for a designer to express those traits in "futuristic" art. They must if they want us to accept their drawings as "futuristic".

## The Past

We've seen art reflect a shared conception of a chaotic future before: in the early 20th century, the [Futurist][2] art movement took modernizing societies by storm.

Futurists "[were fascinated by the problems of representing modern experience][3]". The cacophonous imagery, the dynamism, and the intractable complexity of futurist works seems to bespeak a future where progress and modernity encompass, and eventually redefine humanity. While no futurist artist ever used a computer, contemporary designers seem ever eager to continue in their tradition when imagining our own future.

## The Future

I believe we will inevitably create the world we really want to live in. It's unlikely anyone will make an interface as complicated as those shown above -- if they did no one would use it! So instead, we should imagine futuristic interfaces more in line with what we want, rather than what we expect.
