# The Interface of The Future

What will it be like to live in the future? Exciting, dynamic...and terrifyingly complicated?

My first job after college involved designing and building dozens of software tech demos. One day, my boss asked me to make a tech demo that felt "futuristic". Surely other designers had solved this problem before, so I typed "futuristic interface" into Google Image Search for inspiration. [Try it yourself!][0] You might notice something quite funny:

In my mind, here is what these interfaces tell us about the future:

* **The future is stressful.** We will be working with so much information so quickly that we'll need to have it all in view, all the time.
* **The future is monotonous.** Future humans will not have any appreciation for any colors besides blue. So future designers will make most interfaces blue.
* **The future is complicated.** So complicated that the only way to represent certain information is in highly detailed, mostly circular, [constantly shifting][1] viziualizations. Only highly trained savants will be able to live there.

Initially, I was surprised that so many designers feel that this is the future we are headed towards. If you ask most designers about their principles, you'll hear something along the lines of "keep it simple". Good designers know that success of many software products is due, in large part, to their simplicity. The best designers of our era are best known for making products simpler, cutting out process steps, and making users feel in control, rather than overwhelmed. <Insert obligatory iPhone reference here\>. So why do some designers feel that future designers will go in the opposite direction and make products more complicated?

Thinking about this question more deeply, I realized that designers don't feel this way at all: customers do. When you ask a designer to "make something that feels \_\_\_\_\_" what you're really asking is "make somethat feels \_\_\_\_\_ \[to me\]".
